                            <center><img aria-setsize="50" width=400px height=300px src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3993212/pexels-photo-3993212.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940"><br> <br></center>
                            <font aria-setsize="40"><b>Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A coronavirus identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19.</b></font><br> <hr>
                            <font aria-setsize="20">As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.</font><br> <br> 
                            <center><img aria-setsize="30" width=400px height=300px src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4031867/pexels-photo-4031867.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940"><br> <br> </center>
                            <font aria-setsize="20" >
                                The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause was a then-new coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal and changed (mutated) so it could cause illness in humans. In the past, several infectious disease outbreaks have been traced to viruses originating in birds, pigs, bats and other animals that mutated to become dangerous to humans. Research continues, and more study may reveal how and why the coronavirus evolved to cause pandemic disease.<br><br>
                                <b>What is the incubation period for COVID-19?</b><br> <hr>
                                Symptoms show up in people within two to 14 days of exposure to the virus. A person infected with the coronavirus is contagious to others for up to two days before symptoms appear, and they remain contagious to others for 10 to 20 days, depending upon their immune system and the severity of their illness. <br> <br>

                                <b>What are symptoms of coronavirus?</b><br> <hr>
                                Some people infected with the coronavirus have mild COVID-19 illness, and others have no symptoms at all. In some cases, however, COVID-19 can lead to respiratory failure, lasting lung and heart muscle damage, nervous system problems, kidney failure or death.<br><br>

                                If you have a fever or any of the symptoms listed above, call your doctor or a health care provider and explain your symptoms over the phone before going to the doctor’s office, urgent care facility or emergency room. Here are suggestions if you feel sick and are concerned you might have COVID-19.<br>

                        <font aria-setsize="20">China hands out at least twice as much development money as the US and other major powers, new evidence shows, with most of it coming in the form of risky high-interest loans from Chinese state banks.
                        The sheer amount of Chinese lending is startling. Not too long ago China received foreign aid, but now the tables have turned.
                        Over an 18-year period, China has granted or loaned money to 13,427 infrastructure projects worth $843bn across 165 countries, according to the AidData research lab at William & Mary, a university in the US state of Virginia.
                        Much of this money is linked to Chinese President Xi Jinping's ambitious Belt and Road strategy. Starting in 2013, it leverages China's expertise in infrastructure projects, and ample foreign currency, to build new global trading routes.</font><br> <br> 
                        <img aria-setsize="30" width=250px height=150px src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B0F6/production/_120720354_optimised-uschinaodaoof-nc.png"><br><hr>
                        <font aria-setsize="20" >
                            However, critics fear that the high-interest loans funding many Chinese projects are saddling unsuspecting populations in sky-high debt.
                        And that's news even to Chinese officials themselves. The AidData researchers - who have spent four years tracing all of China's global lending and spending - say that Chinese government ministries are regularly going to them for information on how Chinese money is being used overseas.
                        "We hear from public officials in China all the time, saying 'Look, you're in the only game in town'," explains Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. "They say: 'We can't get our hands on this data internally'."
                        A twisting railway running between China and the neighbouring country of Laos is often touted as a prime example of China's off-the-books lending.

                        <b>Amazon is continuing its quest to cover our homes and bodies with Amazon devices.</b><br> <hr>
                        At a livestreamed media event on Tuesday, the company showed off a handful of new Amazon-branded products, including an Echo device that hangs on the wall and acts as a digital whiteboard for the home, an interactive video chat portal for kids, and a Ring security service that monitors activity on your property. And then there's a new robot equipped with cameras named Astro that navigates your home while you're away.
                        The announcements come as Amazon (AMZN) looks for more ways to push people deeper into its ecosystem, especially when it comes to interacting with products around the house. The latest batch of products not only join Amazon's existing collection of smart speakers and wearables but its lineup of oddball devices, which range from voice-assistant connected microwaves to wall clocks.
                        "Smart home potential extends well beyond where we are today," said Jonathan Collins, a research director at market research firm ABI Research. "Not every new Amazon product category can be successful and many are dropped quite quickly, but it is clear that Amazon is continually trying new product ideas to see where there is demand and where it can create additional value to further strengthen its relationship with consumers."
                        <b>Amazon Echo Show 15</b><br><hr>
                        In 2014, Amazon ignited a smart home revolution with its Echo smart speaker line. Now it wants a rather large one to serve as a central device for managing your household needs.
                        The new Echo Show 15, its biggest Echo device to date, features a 15.6-inch HD display that can be mounted on walls, cabinets or placed on the counter, either horizontally or vertically. A customizable home screen features Alexa-specific apps that allows users to control smart home devices, track packages, leave notes for other people in the house, add to shopping lists and view shared calendars. It also works with streaming services such as Prime Video, Netflix and Hulu.
                        The Echo Show 15 will cost $249; countertop stands and cabinet mount accessories will be sold for an additional cost.
