                            <img aria-setsize="50" width=250px height=150px src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11D2B/production/_120730037_9c774df6-c1cb-402b-9434-fdb483739c36.jpg"><br> <br>
                            <font aria-setsize="40"><b>North Korea has claimed that it successfully tested a new hypersonic missile called Hwasong-8 on Tuesday.</b></font><br> <hr>
                            <font aria-setsize="20">State media said the new missile was one of the "five most important" new weapons systems laid out in its five-year military development plan.
                                They called the missile a "strategic weapon", which usually means it has nuclear capabilities.                                
                                Tuesday's launch is another indication of Pyongyang's growing weapons technology amid strict sanctions.
                                "The development of this weapons system...[has increased] the nation's capabilities for self-defence in every way," North Korean state news outlet KCNA said.
                                Tuesday's launch also saw North Korea introduce missile fuel ampoule for the first time - described by North Korea analyst Ankit Panda as a "significant milestone".</font><br> <br> 
                            <img aria-setsize="30" width=250px height=150px src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14C5A/production/_120528058_070574940-2.jpg"><br> <br> 
                            <font aria-setsize="20" >
                                This is a technology that allows missiles to be pre-fuelled and then sent to the field in canisters. This means it could potentially stay launch-ready for years.
                                The latest launch also marked the country's third missile test this month. It has already revealed a new type of cruise missile, as a well as a new train-launched ballistic missile system.
                                Yesterday's launch came as its North Korean envoy Kim Song defended the country's right to develop weapons at the annual UN General Assembly in New York.
                                Mr Kim said the country was "building up our national defence in order to defend ourselves and reliably safeguard the security and peace of the country".<br><br>
                                <b>What is a hypersonic missile?</b><br> <hr>
                                Hypersonic missiles are much faster and more agile than normal ones, making them much harder for missile defence systems to intercept.
                                North Korea joins a small pool of countries, including the United States, Russia, China and India, in attempting to develop the weapons. In July Russia announced that it had successfully launched a hypersonic missile which reached a speed of 8659.88km/h (5381mph) from a frigate in the White Sea.
                                KCNA said the test launch confirmed the "navigational control and stability of the missile".
                                Mr Panda, a Stanton Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it was difficult at this point to assess the "precise capabilities" of the missile, but added that it could "presumably present a very different challenge for missile defence from traditional ballistic missiles".
                                This addition of the missile fuel ampoule means the weapon would be ready to be fired straight away. If it doesn't need to be fuelled out in the field, it means the launch time is much quicker. The quicker launch time also means it's more difficult for other countries to make a pre-emptive strike.
                                North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had at an earlier meeting in January declared that scientists had "finished research" into developing hypersonic gliding warheads. Tuesday's test was the first for this new system.
                                "The push to develop a hypersonic glider isn't all too surprising given that Kim Jong Un had indicated this back in January," said Mr Panda.
                                "This is, however, a reminder that Mr Kim's missile ambitions are far from having run their course."
                                However, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said they believed this hypersonic missile was still at an early stage of development and it will take a considerable period of time before it can be deployed in combat. They added that both South Korea and the US are currently capable of detecting and intercepting this missile.<br> <br>

                                It has also repeatedly accused South Korea of double standards over military activities.
                                South Korea recently tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, which it said was needed as deterrence against North Korea's "provocations".
                                Last month the UN atomic agency said North Korea appeared to have restarted a reactor which could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, calling it a "deeply troubling" development.<br>

                        <font aria-setsize="20">China hands out at least twice as much development money as the US and other major powers, new evidence shows, with most of it coming in the form of risky high-interest loans from Chinese state banks.
                        The sheer amount of Chinese lending is startling. Not too long ago China received foreign aid, but now the tables have turned.
                        Over an 18-year period, China has granted or loaned money to 13,427 infrastructure projects worth $843bn across 165 countries, according to the AidData research lab at William & Mary, a university in the US state of Virginia.
                        Much of this money is linked to Chinese President Xi Jinping's ambitious Belt and Road strategy. Starting in 2013, it leverages China's expertise in infrastructure projects, and ample foreign currency, to build new global trading routes.</font><br> <br> 
                        <img aria-setsize="30" width=250px height=150px src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B0F6/production/_120720354_optimised-uschinaodaoof-nc.png"><br><hr>
                        <font aria-setsize="20" >
                            However, critics fear that the high-interest loans funding many Chinese projects are saddling unsuspecting populations in sky-high debt.
                        And that's news even to Chinese officials themselves. The AidData researchers - who have spent four years tracing all of China's global lending and spending - say that Chinese government ministries are regularly going to them for information on how Chinese money is being used overseas.
                        "We hear from public officials in China all the time, saying 'Look, you're in the only game in town'," explains Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. "They say: 'We can't get our hands on this data internally'."
                        A twisting railway running between China and the neighbouring country of Laos is often touted as a prime example of China's off-the-books lending.

                        <b>Amazon is continuing its quest to cover our homes and bodies with Amazon devices.</b><br> <hr>
                        At a livestreamed media event on Tuesday, the company showed off a handful of new Amazon-branded products, including an Echo device that hangs on the wall and acts as a digital whiteboard for the home, an interactive video chat portal for kids, and a Ring security service that monitors activity on your property. And then there's a new robot equipped with cameras named Astro that navigates your home while you're away.
                        The announcements come as Amazon (AMZN) looks for more ways to push people deeper into its ecosystem, especially when it comes to interacting with products around the house. The latest batch of products not only join Amazon's existing collection of smart speakers and wearables but its lineup of oddball devices, which range from voice-assistant connected microwaves to wall clocks.
                        "Smart home potential extends well beyond where we are today," said Jonathan Collins, a research director at market research firm ABI Research. "Not every new Amazon product category can be successful and many are dropped quite quickly, but it is clear that Amazon is continually trying new product ideas to see where there is demand and where it can create additional value to further strengthen its relationship with consumers."
                        <b>Amazon Echo Show 15</b><br><hr>
                        In 2014, Amazon ignited a smart home revolution with its Echo smart speaker line. Now it wants a rather large one to serve as a central device for managing your household needs.
                        The new Echo Show 15, its biggest Echo device to date, features a 15.6-inch HD display that can be mounted on walls, cabinets or placed on the counter, either horizontally or vertically. A customizable home screen features Alexa-specific apps that allows users to control smart home devices, track packages, leave notes for other people in the house, add to shopping lists and view shared calendars. It also works with streaming services such as Prime Video, Netflix and Hulu.
                        The Echo Show 15 will cost $249; countertop stands and cabinet mount accessories will be sold for an additional cost.
